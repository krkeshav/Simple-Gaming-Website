        <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-5px;">Arkham Asylum, the first Batman game from Rocksteady Studios, had the sense of a fresh beginning for superhero action games. Batman: Arkham Knight has a sense of finality. It builds on the revolutionary strike-and-counter fighting style with powerful
            new moves and enemies; it expands on Arkham City’s open world with a larger, more detailed version of Gotham; it introduces a new fully playable Batmobile and makes it an important part of the action and puzzles; and it brings all of Batman’s
            closest family of Gotham superheroes and rogues together for an amazing, great-looking finale.<br><br></p><iframe width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDNNUU5M54Y?rel=0"></iframe>
        <p
            style="font-size:24px;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:356px;height:299px;">Roughly 12 hours’ worth of story missions do a great job of playing up the long history between Batman, the three Robins, and Jim and Barbara Gordon. The plot does stray a little too far into the supernatural for my tastes -- in that I generally
            find the Dark Knight at his finest when the threats he faces are at least remotely grounded in reality -- but in doing so it drives wedges between allies and delves into Batman’s psyche in an interesting way. <br> <br>While the mystery of
            the identity of the Arkham Knight (a militarized anti-Batman who serves as co-antagonist along with the Scarecrow) fizzles out, there are other surprises to fall back on that kept me engaged in the twisting story. Plus, several strong performances
            gave it personality: the unsettling monotone voice of John Noble makes this the eeriest version of the Scarecrow yet, Mark Hamill returns for some excellent, darkly hilarious posthumous Joker lines and reenactments of some of the most famous
            scenes from the comics, and of course the definitive Kevin Conroy stars as Batman. Here and there a few cheesy, wooden lines pop up, mostly in the side quests, but the same is true of nearly any game of this size. <br> <br><br></p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:10px;"></h3><iframe width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpXUIh7rlWI?rel=0" style="width:20.5em;height:9.5em;margin-bottom:22px;"></iframe>
            <p style="font-size:24px;"><br>And its size is significant. We’re now free to explore three islands of the dark and intermittently stormy Gotham City, which is given character and color by its many bright neon lights and noticeable landmarks like the Chinatown district,
                Wayne Tower, and Ace Chemicals. All of which are beautifully detailed, and the lighting effects reflecting off wet streets and capes highlight impressive texture detail. The city has been evacuated again, which conveniently makes it impossible
                to accidentally or intentionally beat up innocents, but the streets are far livelier than in past games thanks to vastly increased populations of criminals, both on foot and engaging in high-speed pursuits with Gotham Police cars. (The
                animation you get from countering them when they try to run you down is hilarious.) Notably, we don’t return to the Batcave in Arkham Knight, which is fine by me considering how much time was spent there in the past two Arkham games.<br><br></p>

                <ul style="font-size:24px;">
                    <li>Excellent gameplay variety</li>
                    <li>Strong performances</li>

                <h1 style="color:rgb(56,136,201);"><strong>Cons</strong></h1>
                <ul style="font-size:24;">
                    <li style="font-size:24px;">Tank feels out of place</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 style="font-size:32;color:rgb(56,136,201);margin-top:36px;"><strong>The Verdict</strong></h1>
                <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-3px;">If this is in fact the last Rocksteady-developed Batman game, the series will end on a high note. Arkham Knight is the biggest Batman game yet, not just in map size, but in the wide range of different types of gameplay, and its collection
                    of characters. The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham
                    City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level. <br> <br></p>
