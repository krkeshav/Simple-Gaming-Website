        <h3 style="color:rgb(131,131,131);">The wilderness of Montana isn't as exotic a playground, but it's just as full of things to do.<br></h3>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top:18px;height:504;width:930;">
        <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-5px;">Ever since Far Cry 3, sneaking my way through outposts eliminating enemies one by one has been one of my favorite things to do in video games. I’m happy to report that systematically taking down murderous thugs is just as fun in rural America
            as it is in the Himalayas, and that Far Cry 5 is another great game in the open-world series Ubisoft seems most willing to have fun with. It may be playing a familiar tune, but all of these combat, physics, and wildlife systems all mix together
            to create unexpected moments of intense and hilarious action. <br> <br>This time around you play as a sheriff’s deputy, part of a task force sent into the fictional Hope County, Montana. Rural America may not be quite as exotic or exciting
            a playground as a tropical island or a secluded mountain, but it’s a gigantic open world where things are constantly blowing up, wild animals are pouncing, and a never-ending supply of cultists are lining up to be your target practice. The
            mountains, valleys, plains, forests, rivers, lakes, and caves of Hope County make it a place where there’s never a dull moment.<br></p><iframe width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FD9ON97JYgk?rel=0"></iframe>
        <h2
            style="color:rgb(56,136,201);"><strong>Being stranded and hunted by well-armed militia was a very cool moment.</strong><br></h2>
            <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:-7px;height:299px;">With all of that scenery and action, Far Cry 5 is a nice-looking game, but it isn’t on the same level as, say, Horizon: Zero Dawn. Even comparing it to another recent open-world Ubisoft game, it’s not quite as attractive as Assassin’s Creed
                Origins. It’s generally good enough, but I was sometimes distracted by the pop-in caused by the density of the landscape. Even on the PS4 Pro, it’s hard not to notice all the magically appearing trees as you stroll through the wilderness.
                In fact, other than resolution on a 4K TV, there isn’t a stark difference between the PS4 and the Pro at all.<br></p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Score : 8.2</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxyddkgX_TA?rel=0" style="width:20.5em;height:9.5em;margin-bottom:22px;"></iframe>
            <h2 style="color:rgb(56,136,201);">Two players generate twice as much chaos.<br></h2>
            <p style="font-size:24px;">Further enhancing the replayability of Far Cry 5 is Far Cry Arcade, an entirely new mode separate from the campaign where you can create your own levels. It aims to keep you playing long after you’ve cleared out the Hope County map, but in
                its current state it’s a bit of a disappointment if you’re looking to play rather than create. The editing tools are very in-depth and a handful of different mission types can be created, but this isn’t something you can casually sit down
                with and whip up your own level. Creating something worth playing will take time, patience, and actual level design skills.<br></p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:24px;">Score : 8.9</h3>
            <h1 style="font-size:32;color:rgb(56,136,201);margin-top:36px;"><strong>The Verdict</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-3px;">Far Cry 5 is another wide-open playground with all the necessary ingredients for causing a real ruckus: loads of enemies and allies, temperamental wildlife, and plenty of explosions. Amidst all the insanity it manages to tell a serious story
                with respectable characters and a powerful ending, though it’s not the most memorable in the series. The successful transition from exotic locales to America’s backyard makes me excited to see where the Far Cry formula goes next.<br></p>
