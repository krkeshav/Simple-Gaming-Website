        <h3 style="color:rgb(131,131,131);">A shooter that’s as invested in creating a smart, nuanced survival experience as it is fun, action-packed combat.<br></h3>

        <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:29px;">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds didn’t invent the last-person-standing formula that’s made it one of the most massively successful PC games in history, but – over the course of a nine-month-long early access period – it certainly turned it into
            something special. 100 players drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever weapons they can find within a shrinking force-field. This simple, bare-bones take on the Battle Royale-style deathmatch foregoes the fluff and
            high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in favor of fast, accessible action. The result is a tight, focused, no-frills experience that’s as exciting as it is unpredictable, and where no two games are ever alike.<br></p>

            <p style="font-size:24px;">We’ve done separate, in-depth reviews for the single-player campaign and multiplayer. Here’s what Ryan McCaffrey said about this year’s Call of Duty campaign in his review:<br></p>
            <h2 style="color:rgb(56,136,201);"><strong>Action isn't hard to find if you're looking for it, and impossible to avoid for long.</strong><br></h2>
            <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-28px;margin-bottom:49px;height:299px;"><br>The two large maps aren't the best-looking environments in gaming, but they do provide much-needed variety on the battlefield. Both the forested island of Erangel and the sunny desert of Miramar boast an assortment of small towns, large,
                dense cityscapes, and rural industrial zones ripe with loot. There are some parallels between maps so as not to restrict your options when you’re dropped randomly into either one (the server picks for you). For instance, the small military
                base on an island off the coast of Erangel sees its match in Miramar’s remote military camp, for the high-risk players looking to compete for high-level equipment right off the bat.<br></p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Score : 8.2</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqLhqxzbxqA?rel=0" style="width:20.5em;height:9.5em;margin-bottom:22px;"></iframe>
            <h2 style="color:rgb(56,136,201);"><strong>Last One(s) Standing</strong><br></h2>
            <p style="font-size:24px;">The entire dynamic of both exploration and combat changes drastically by grouping up in the pre-game lobby. Playing solo brings certain elements to the formula that going in with a partner doesn’t, and the same goes for trios and four-player
                squads. There might be more freedom and greater opportunity for stealth in going alone, but a well-coordinated team has more potential for pulling off exciting ambushes and vehicular assaults – and they’re much more survivable because
                you can revive a teammate who’s been knocked down but not finished off. Playing in first-person-only servers also brings a new, challenging dimension to matches by eliminating the corner-peaking advantages granted by the default third-person
                camera.</p>
            <h2 style="color:rgb(56,136,201);"><strong>The gunplay itself is also great .</strong></h2>
            <p style="font-size:24px;">The gunplay itself is also great. Firearms feel good to shoot and there’s a good range of options for all playstyles. And while PUBG does retain that military-sim stiffness that’s become synonymous with the genre, it’s just smoothed out enough
                to keep combat and movement satisfying and accessible to newcomers. The new vaulting system (added as PUBG left Early Access) is a particularly handy addition, allowing you to climb over fences and through windows for easier getaways and
                sneakier shortcuts.</p>
            <h1 style="font-size:32;color:rgb(56,136,201);margin-top:36px;"><strong>The Verdict</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size:24px;margin-top:-3px;">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based
                action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end.<br></p>
